          Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers
          over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife
          and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half
          the world's active geysers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among
          the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by
          getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
          bad decisions by visiting

        <br />
        <p>
          Rome is one of the oldest metropolitan areas in the world. With a
          history dating back to 700 BC with the birth of the Roman Empire, the
          city has maintained its status as a cultural and historical hub of
          Europe. The city is peppered with ancient monuments, statues, and
          piazzas from different eras of history. The most famous location, the
          Colosseum, is touted as one of the seven modern wonders of the world.
          Rome houses several world famous museums, such as the Borghese and the
          Vatican Museum. It is also the only city in the world to encompass a
          recognized country, Vatican City.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rome is also a great location for food, wine, and leisure. At the
          heart of Italy, Rome is a central gathering place for a diverse array
          of Italian cuisine; Neapolitan Pizza from the south, Tuscan wine, and
          truffle from the north. Rome’s most famous dish is carbonara. Beyond
          the food, Rome has a vibrant nightlife. The Trastevere neighborhood
          has plenty of bars and clubs for patrons and, just over the river,
          Centro’s shopping district is always bustling.
